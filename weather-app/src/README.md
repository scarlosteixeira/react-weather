# Weather App

## Description

React app that consumes the OpenWeather API to get the current weather for a given city. As part of General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive course.

This is a simple weather app that uses the aforementioned API, inbuilt JavaScript Geolocation API to automaticaly get the latitude and longitude of the users position, as far as the user allow it on browser, and GeoDB Cities API on the search bar that returns city name, country name, latitude and longitude of the searched city.

## Getting Started

The project can be accessed on **[my Git Hub profile on React-weater repository.](https://github.com/scarlosteixeira/react-weather)** <br>
This project is open source and can be downloaded, used and modified by anyone, as far as credit is given.

Solo project, to be completed within 1 week, split as it follows: <br>

1. 1 day of whiteboarding and singing off.
2. 2 days for research, development and coding.
3. 2 days to get a minimum viable project.
4. 1 days for polishing, bug fixing.
5. 1 day to present the completed project.

## Brief

### Overview

The second project is to **build a React application** that consumes a **public API**.

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

* **Consume a public API** â€“ this could be anything but it must make sense for your project.
* **Include wireframes** - that you designed before building the app.
* Have **semantically clean HTML** - you make sure you write HTML that makes structural sense rather than thinking about how it might look, which is the job of CSS.
* **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public.

## Planning

I made a simple wireframe of the app, using **[wireframepro from mockflow.](https://wireframepro.mockflow.com/)**.
